## Windows Installation

### Place SimShift folder in ETS2 Main Folder

### Revert to version 1.19
- **[Guide](https://forum.truckersmp.com/index.php?/topic/17-how-to-downgrade-ets2ats-to-supported-version/)**
- Revert to version 1.19x **FIRST** before doing any of the next instructions

### Extract base.scs and def.scs 
**Highly reccomended:** Use [SCS EXTRACTOR GUI](https://github.com/Bluscream/SCS-Extractor-GUI/releases)
1. Open SCS Extractor GUI
2. Navigate to ETS2 folder `steam\steamapps\common\Euro Truck Simulator 2\`
3. Extract base.scs (GUI will place in `\Euro Truck Simulator 2\base`)
    - THIS WILL TAKE A WHILE, THE COMMAND PROMPT WILL CLOSE BY ITSELF, DO NOT CLOSE EARLY
4. Extract def.scs (GUI will place in `\Euro Truck Simulator 2\def`)

### Install SDK Plugin for ETS2
1. Get [SDK Plugin](https://github.com/nlhans/ets2-sdk-plugin/releases)
2. Place the acquired DLL inside bin/win_x86/plugins/ of your ETS2 installation.
